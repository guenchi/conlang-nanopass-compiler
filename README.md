# Conlang Nanopass Compiler
A compiler to help creating constructed language

I have been researching artificial language creation since about 2006.

[Here](https://github.com/guenchi/language-creating) is an archive and public demonstration of some of my work in 2011.

Undertake the constructed language design needed in novels, movies, TV series and other works.

In the actual language creation work, it takes a lot of time to deal with vocabulary generation, language conversion (when you need a close relative language group, the best way is to create their mother language, and then create a set of rules for the evolution of speech to generate Several required sub-language).

The inspiration from computer compilation theory is that we can relate the speech and vocabulary of all languages to a specific IR. In phonetics, international phonetic symbols are a good choice.

This project is inspired by the nanopass compiler framework. And use Scheme to handle language generation.
